# Using RememberED

Okay then! Now that you've installed RememberED, you can start using it. But how? Well, this section will teach you how to use RememberED. Let's get started! First of all, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run run
```

This will open the app. You'll probably see something like this:

As the prompt suggests, you can get started by clicking on the "New Note" button in the bottom left-hand corner. This will open a new window, where you can start typing your note. After creating one, it will appear in the list on the left as "Untitled". You can go ahead and click on it to open it. You'll see this:

Each note consists of a name (title) and a description (or content). By default, these are "Untitled" and... Nothing. So each time you create a note, you'll have to change these. The name can be customized by clicking and typing something in top bar (the little one). The description isn't required and can be modified by typing in the large text area (it also resizes along with your note if you have something HUGE to write down in there).

When you're done with your changes, you need to save them by clicking the "Save Note" button in the bottom. But please make sure that a note is opened before you use it, because otherwise it'll be grayed out and you won't be able to click it. Notes are saved in the `notetaker.json` file in the root directory of the app, you can delete the file itself if you want to get rid of all your notes at once.

Take a look at this image:

You can see that the text in the note is formatted differently. This is because we have a formatting toolbar, which you can use to customize your text. It currently supports some basic text formatting. The toolbar is pretty self-explanatory, so I won't go into much detail here.

## But this is not all!

RememberED is still in its early stages of development, so it's not quite... done yet. At the moment, we're working hard to add new features and improve the existing ones. Expect to see a lot more updates and tools in the future!
