# Welcome to RememberED!

Welcome to RememberED, a desktop application that helps you note stuff down and remember them later, with enabled formatting options and several other customization tools. It is optimized for use via a clean GUI, written in Node.js and Electron. Soon enough, we'll also support features like voice recognition and sticky notes! In RememberED, you can create notes without worrying about them your privacy, speed, and memory!
