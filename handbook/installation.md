# How to install RememberED?

At the moment, the app is only installable via the source code. We'll soon be releasing the binaries on our website (work in progress). To install the app, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you have it installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LyubomirT/remembered.git
``` 

```bash
cd remembered
```

```bash
npm install
```

I'm sure that was pretty simple. Anyways, now you can run the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm run run
```
