 ## Code of Conduct

In order to foster a welcoming and inclusive community, we adhere to the following principles:

1. Be Respectful: Treat everyone with kindness and politeness. Refrain from insulting, demeaning, harassing, or discriminatory speech or actions based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, marital status, disability, or any other protected characteristic.

2. Assume Good Intentions: When interpreting another person's words or actions, assume they were intended positively. Give people the benefit of the doubt and strive for constructive dialogue.

3. Collaborate Openly: Share knowledge and collaborate openly towards common goals. Encourage participation, provide feedback, and help mentor those who want to learn more about the project.

4. Take Responsibility: Own your mistakes and work together to resolve them. Apologize sincerely when needed, then focus on fixing problems rather than assigning blame.

5. Stay On Topic: Keep discussions related to the project scope and purpose. Avoid distractions, side conversations, or off-topic debates that could derail progress.

If anyone violates this Code of Conduct, we reserve the right to take action, including warnings, timeouts, bans, or removal of content, depending on the severity of the violation.

To report violations, contact us via Discord (@lyubomirt), email (ternavski103@gmail.com), or file an issue directly in this repository. All reports will be handled confidentially and discreetly.
